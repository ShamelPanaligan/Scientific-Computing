# Scientific-Computing
In this folder, I'll be applying pure maths, to build programs in relation to the topic.
- Argand_Diagram.py : A program that allows for interactive argand diagram plotting with the user
- DeMoivre.ipynb : A notebook that explores De Moivres theorem including its verification, the effects of powers on a complex number and its link to roots of unity
- Sinusoids_Phasers.py : A simple program that compares an Argand Diagram to a Signal graph
